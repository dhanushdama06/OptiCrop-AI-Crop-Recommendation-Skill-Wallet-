# 🌱 OptiCrop – AI Crop Recommendation System

## 📌 Overview

OptiCrop is an AI-powered Crop Recommendation System that helps farmers, agricultural researchers, and agribusiness professionals select the most suitable crop based on soil nutrients and environmental conditions.

The application uses Machine Learning algorithms trained on agricultural data to predict the best crop using:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorous (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Soil pH
- Rainfall

The project is developed using Flask for the web application and Scikit-learn for machine learning.
